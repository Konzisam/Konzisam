- 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Konzi, a coding ethusiast specializing in data: from data sourcing, transformation, to dashboarding and Machine Learning. I’ve also expanded my expertise to include the software development lifecycle and cloud resource provisioning, ensuring the delivery of robust and scalable solutions.


- 👀 I enjoy using data to convey useful insights as well as designing and maintaining the pipelines to ensure continous and reliablity of data.


- 🌱Here is a glimpse of some of the [dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel.konzi) I have built. 


- 💞️ When I am not coding or building a dashboard I will be playing my guitar somewhere in Berlin or meeting friends. 



- 📫 My favourite technical book so far is 'Designing data Intensive Applications' by Martin Kleppmann.
