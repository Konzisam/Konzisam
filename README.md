- 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Konzi, a coding ethusiast specializing in data: from data sourcing, transformation, to dashboarding and Machine Learning. My main tools of work are Python and SQL.

- 👀 I enjoy using data to convey useful insights as well as designing and maintaining the pipelines to ensure continous and reliablity of data. Recently I started blogging on (medium)[https://medium.com/@konzisamuel].

- 🌱Here is a glimpse of some of the (dashboards)[https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel.konzi] I have built. 

- 💞️ When I am not coding or building a dashboard I will be playing my guitar somewhere in Berlin or meeting friends. 

- 📫 My favourite technical book so far is 'Designing data Intensive Applications' by Martin Kleppmann.
