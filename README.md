## 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel , a coding ethusiast specializing in data.

- Proficient in data sourcing, transformation, to dashboarding, Machine Learning and MLOps.
- I’ve also expanded my knowledge to software development and cloud resources provisioning, ensuring the delivery of robust and scalable solutions.

- 👀 I enjoy using data to convey useful insights as well as designing and maintaining the pipelines to ensure continous and reliablity of data.


- 🌱Here is a glimpse of some tableau [dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel.konzi) I have built. 


- 💞️ When I am not coding or building a dashboard I will be playing my guitar somewhere in Berlin or meeting friends. 


- 📫 My favourite technical book so far is 'Designing data Intensive Applications' by Martin Kleppmann.
